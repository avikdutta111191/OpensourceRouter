## Features
A **10Gbps 8-port router**, especially for high-performance environments like businesses, data centers, or advanced home networks, there are several critical features to ensure performance, scalability, security, and management. Below are the must-have features:

### 1. 10Gbps Ethernet Ports (8 Ports)
- **Full 10Gbps Throughput**: All 8 ports should support full-duplex 10Gbps Ethernet to handle massive data traffic without bottlenecks.
- **SFP+/RJ45 Support**: A combination of SFP+ (fiber) and RJ45 (copper) ports provides flexibility for different connection types.

### 2. Hardware Acceleration
- **Dedicated Networking Hardware**: Offloading tasks like packet forwarding, firewall filtering, and encryption to specialized hardware reduces latency and enhances performance.
- **ASIC/FPGA-Based Processing**: ASICs or FPGAs are ideal for low-latency processing of high data rates.

### 3. Routing Protocols
- **Dynamic Routing**: Support for BGP, OSPF, and RIP is essential for dynamic routing and scalable networks.
- **IPv6 Support**: Full IPv6 support for future-proofing your network.
- **Static and Policy-Based Routing**: For controlling traffic flows with specific policies or routes.

### 4. Advanced Firewall Capabilities
- **Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI)**: Deep packet inspection to monitor and control traffic.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**: Effective management of IP addresses, especially for mixed internal/external networks.
- **Application Layer Filtering**: Granular control over specific application traffic (Layer 7).

### 5. Traffic Shaping & QoS (Quality of Service)
- **Bandwidth Management**: Prioritizing traffic (e.g., voice, video) to ensure critical services receive enough bandwidth.
- **Traffic Shaping**: Optimizing data flows to avoid bottlenecks and maximize network resource usage.

### 6. VPN Support (With Hardware-Based Acceleration)
- **Multi-protocol VPN Support**: Support for VPNs like IPsec, OpenVPN, and WireGuard for secure connections.
- **Hardware-Accelerated VPN**: Hardware-accelerated encryption to maintain high performance in VPN connections.

### 7. Link Aggregation (LACP)
- **802.3ad Link Aggregation**: Combine multiple ports to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy.
- **Load Balancing & Failover**: Aggregate ports for both load balancing and failover protection.

### 8. High-Performance CPU & Memory
- **Multicore CPU**: A powerful multi-core CPU (e.g., ARM, Intel Xeon) to handle 10Gbps routing, NAT, and VPN tasks.
- **Sufficient RAM**: At least 4GB of RAM, preferably expandable, to support high throughput and concurrent connections.

### 9. Redundant Power Supply (High Availability)
- **Dual Power Supply**: Redundant power supplies ensure the router remains operational in case of a PSU failure.

### 10. Advanced Security Features
- **DDoS Protection**: Built-in DDoS mitigation tools.
- **Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDS/IPS)**: Real-time monitoring and prevention using tools like Suricata or Snort.
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Secure administrative interfaces with SSL/TLS.

### 11. Network Monitoring and Diagnostics
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tools for real-time traffic, performance, and bandwidth monitoring.
- **SNMP & Syslog**: Integration into enterprise-level monitoring systems.
- **NetFlow/sFlow**: For traffic flow visibility and analysis.

### 12. Modular Operating System (Linux or FreeBSD-based)
- **Customizable OS**: Open-source platforms like **OpenWrt**, **pfSense**, or **VyOS** offer customization options.
- **Plugin/Extension Support**: The ability to add or remove features like firewalls, VPNs, and IDS/IPS.

### 15. Firmware/Software Updates and Patch Management
- **Automated Updates**: Regular and secure updates to patch vulnerabilities and improve performance.
- **Long-Term Support (LTS)**: Ensure the software has long-term support for critical updates and patches.

### 16. Storage (For Logs, Cache, etc.)
